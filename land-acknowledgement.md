# Land Acknowledgement

We would like to acknowledge the Lenni-Lenape people who are the original inhabitants of Lenapehoking and the island of Mannahatta. The land The New School University is built upon, including all of  New York City, present-day New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania along the Delaware River watershed, western Long Island, and the Lower Hudson Valley, comprise Lenape ancestral homeland. This land was not ceded nor sold, as folklore would have us believe, to the Dutch for beads and trinkets.  

This land was forcibly taken through occupation by European settlers, resulting in displacement, forced migration, and genocide. In the present day there are Lenape communities throughout North America, though much of the original Lenape territory remains under settler occupation and control. 

As settlers who have benefited from the colonization of sovereign land we acknowledge our responsibility to examine and question systems of oppression that continue through to the present day and educate ourselves about the original stewards of this land. 

*  We also want to acknowledge the Haudenosaunee ironworkers from the Six Nations of the Iroquois, mostly from the Mohawk tribe whose labor built the many iconic skyscrapers and steel bridges in New York City. As recently as 2012 about 200 of the 2,000 structural ironworkers in NYC were Mohawk. Every day we view the city skyline of Manhattan we are reminded of their contribution.
